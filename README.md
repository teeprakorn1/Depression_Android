# 🧠 Depression Simple Android Application (Flutter)

**DepressionSimple Android Application** is a mobile application designed to help assess and predict users' mental health conditions such as **Depression** and **Bipolar Disorder** using an AI model. The application connects to a Python-based backend through an API and was developed as a university project.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Prediction** – Predicts emotional conditions including Depression, Bipolar Type-1, and Type-2 using a trained ML model.
- 📝 **Detailed Questionnaire** – Users fill out a series of emotional and behavioral indicators.
- 📈 **Clear Results** – Returns a categorized result with an explanatory message.
- 🔗 **API Integration** – Connects the Flutter mobile app to the backend through a secure POST request.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

| Component        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **📱 Mobile Frontend (Flutter)** | Developed using Flutter for Android to collect user input and display prediction results. |
| **🧠 AI Backend (Python Flask)** | Provides REST API to serve predictions using a pre-trained Machine Learning model (`Depression_AI.pkl`). |
| **🔗 Communication** | Frontend and backend communicate via HTTP POST requests using a form-based data structure. |

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### 💻 Frontend (Mobile)
- Flutter (Dart)
- HTTP package for API communication
- Minimal, user-friendly UI design

### 🧠 Backend (AI Model API)
- Python
- Flask
- `joblib` to load the trained `.pkl` model
- Numpy
- RESTful API (deployed on port 3000)

## 🧪 How the AI Works

The backend receives 17 symptom-related inputs from the user, including:

- Sadness
- Euphoric behavior
- Suicidal thoughts
- Trouble sleeping
- Aggression
- Overthinking  
... and more.

The model then predicts the user's mental health state as follows:

| Prediction Code | Result |
|-----------------|---------|
| 0               | Normal  |
| 1               | Bipolar Type-1 |
| 2               | Bipolar Type-2 |
| 3               | Depression |
| Other           | Error |
